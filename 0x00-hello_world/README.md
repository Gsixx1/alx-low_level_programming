0x00. C - Hello, World

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Why C programming is awesome
Who invented C
Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
What happens when you type gcc main.c
What is an entry point
What is main
How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
How to compile using gcc
What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
How does the main function influence the return value of the program

 Below are the all the programs done to complete this project.

0. Preprocessor

1. Compiler

2. Assembler

3. Name

4. Hello, puts

5. Hello, printf

6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

7. Intel

8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
